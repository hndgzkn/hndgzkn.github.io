===========================================================
Extracting :math:`\mu`-wave from the somato-sensory dataset
===========================================================

This example illustrates how to learn rank-1 atoms [1]_ on the multivariate
somato-sensorymotor dataset from :code:`mne`. The displayed results highlight
the presence of :math:`\mu`-waves located in the SI cortex.

Let us first define the parameters of our model.

    sfreq = 150.

    # Define the shape of the dictionary
    n_atoms = 25
    n_times_atom = int(round(sfreq * 1.0))  # 1000. ms

Next, we define the parameters for multivariate CSC

Here, we load the data from the somato-sensory dataset and preprocess them
in epochs. The epochs are selected around the stim, starting 2 seconds
before and finishing 4 seconds after.
